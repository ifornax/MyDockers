/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/katsdptelstate/telescope_state.py:338: FutureWarning: The telescope state contains pickled values. This is a security risk, but is allowed because MeerKAT data up to March 2019 uses it. You can suppress this warning by setting KATSDPTELSTATE_ALLOW_PICKLE=1 in the environment, or disable pickles by setting KATSDPTELSTATE_ALLOW_PICKLE=0.
